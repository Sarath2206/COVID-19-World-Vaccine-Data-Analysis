The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the bodyâ€™s natural defenses "The Immune System" to recognize and fight off the virus and bacteria they target. Many vaccines have been developed by different countries for *SARS-Cov 2*
Some of them are listed below:

 -  Pfizerâ€“BioNTech
 -  Oxford
 -  Moderna
 -  Sputnik V
